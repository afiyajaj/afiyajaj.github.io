        <div class="text-block-16">Hiring managers to struggle with finding quality UX candidates because, although they know UX is crucial, they find it difficult to determine what factors make a good UX employee, not to mention there are numerous roles within UX. The struggle is that there is a lack of knowledge on the subject of UX and lack of traditional trajectory-­ people working in UX come from incredibly diverse backgrounds, from mechanical engineering to fine-arts.</div>

      <div class="text-block-16">My hope with this project is to design a Software As a Service application that streamlines the process of hiring UX employees.</div>

    <div class="text-block-6">
      <div class="projectline"><strong>Core principles</strong></div>
      <div class="text-block-15 text-block-16">Hiring managers will go through the application by first educating themselves on the various roles in UX, the different skill sets required for each, then use this information to build an accurate and custom job description. From there, job seekers would apply through a portfolio oriented process where candidates will essentially apply by showcasing their top 3 portfolio pieces. Then, hiring managers look at the pool of candidates and choose their top contenders, only then can they see their further qualifications (resume, Linkedln, rest of the portfolio, and etc.). <br><br>This is due to the fact that case studies are easy indicators of the candidate’s attention to detail, storytelling abilities, design approach and process, capacity for empathy and strategic/business-oriented thinking, whether they have a lean/agile approach, and their strength in user research. <br><br>The portfolio approach lets the skillset/background of candidates to take a backseat because ultimately, the heart of this application is hiring great thinkers, not necessarily great artists, business people or programmers. A focus on skillset can disqualify excellent candidates. Also, due to constantly changing technologies, it is just not a sustainable focus. Instead, a focus on the core competencies of UX designers is a far superior approach.<br></div>

        <div class="text-block-16">To begin, I must identify the problem my users are facing, I can do this by utilizing industry-standard user research methods including contextual and individual interviews, and find out what are the real issues they are facing whilst conducting recruitment, I can also observe how they interact with existing recruitment software and see what pain points they face with them. I also need to determine a research method that will be most compatible with my testers. <br><br>This could either be focus groups, interviews, or surveys. For this to happen, I need to get in contact with people who work in HR, and preferably, people who recruit UX/UI designers, UX researchers, Information Architects, Content Strategists and etc. I also need to get in touch with people who would use the website as job seekers--this part is easier because they could just be fellow classmates.</div>

        <div class="projectline"><strong>Competitive analysis </strong></div>
        <div class="text-block-15 text-block-16">I looked at similar products such as Indeed, a well-known employment marketplace, Upwork, which is more freelance oriented, Toptal, an exclusive hiring platform used by successful startups, and Dribbble, a well-known platform where designers post their best work and recruiters post designer jobs. <br><br>Each platform has something that allows them to stand out from the rest. Indeed is very easy to use and post jobs, but this is used for any job and not at all curated for designers, not to mention it is oversaturated. Also, often unqualified candidates apply and waste both their own time and the recruiter&#x27;s time. Upwork is great, but freelance focused. It also doesn&#x27;t allow for direct viewing of portfolios and focuses heavily on their candidate&#x27;s background and tool oriented skillset. <br><br>Toptal is another excellent hiring platform, but many companies cannot afford to recruit the candidates on there, and it is extremely difficult to be on the platform as a professional as only the &quot;Top 3%&quot; is on there. Lastly, Dribbble is definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve found as it is very much for designers, but the problem is, it is more for UI/Graphic designers and the portfolio pieces are very shallow and don&#x27;t go into depth at all. In fact, all it showcases is merely screenshots and gifs. Thus, it is clearly not made for UX designers.<br></div>

        <div class="projectline"><strong>What did the research say?</strong></div>
        <div class="text-block-16">the core of what hiring managers are looking for in UX employees is a good understand of what UX is and its implementation. Tasks within UX ties together to create the best possible experience for the user. For instance a UXer is to understand and analyze user sets (this is user research and usability testing), they are to plan the layout of information and flow of service (this is the information architecture), they design the way that users progress from one step to another (interaction design) , they plan, write copy and media content (content strategy &amp; development) and they design the interface or overall visual system (visual design). <br><br>These components of UX could be fulfilled by one person--a UX generalist or by specialists that only practice one particular aspect of the UX machine. Ultimately, all UX professionals’ skills fall into the following three categories: user research, information architecture/interaction design and visual design. At smaller companies, the UX people/person may wear all the UX hats whereas at larger corporation UX roles are more specialized. Hiring managers advise when hiring their UX team to avoid fixating on job titles and instead focus on work samples, make sure the potential hire has a tight grasp on all major UX concepts, focus on their ability to empathize and tell stories. They also recommend having a standardized structured criteria for evaluation to avoid subjective decision making. </div>
